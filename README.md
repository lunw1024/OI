# OI
The ultimate OI experience in the terminal and VScode

## terminal
First activate the environment `source scripts/[activate/activate.fish]`  
A list of helpful tools is now available:  
- `run FILE.cpp`: fast compile and run C++ code.
- `run-debug FILE.cpp`: slower compilation, with more safety checks, including index out of bounds.
- `run-with-aclib FILE.cpp`: compile with AC-Lib.

## VScode
`Ctrl+Alt+N`: run current `.cpp` or `.py` file  
`Ctrl+Alt+K`: call `expander.py` to combine current file with [atcoder library](https://github.com/atcoder/ac-library) (Only works for C++)
